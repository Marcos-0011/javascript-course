      //we can get a value out of an array by calling the array with the variable and then typing square brackets (similar to a function). inside the brackets, typing '0' gets us the first value in the array which in this case is 10. typing '1' gets us 20. the numbers inside the square brackets like 0 or 1 is called an index, it represents the position in the array

      //LOOPS: this is called a while loop. while the condition inside the brackets is true, it will continue to run the code until it becomes false. while loop syntax: type while () {}. in the first brackets goes the loop condition. in the second set of brackets goes the loop body which includes the increment step (which makes sure the loop ends at some point). then outside of the while loop, write the loop variable. the loop brackets create a scope, any variable created within the brackets only exists within the brackets

There is technically no increment step and no loop variable that we increase every time. When we have a non-standard loop its better to use a while loop bc they are more flexible

This is called looping through an array.

      //PART 5: COME BACK HERE AFTER FINISHING 1121-TODO-LIST.HTML. detail 1: arrays are references like objects
      const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
      //this array doesn't actually contain the values 1, 2, and 3. this array is saved in the computers memory and the variable array1 contains a reference to that array in the memory
      const array2 = array1.slice();
      //if we make a copy like array2, it doesnt save a copy of the array, it saves a copy of the reference to the array in the memory. so now both variables are "pointing" to the same array
      //to avoid this copy of reference, we can actually copy the values to create a new array by adding .slice() to array1 like in the line of code above
      array2.push(4);
      console.log(array1);
      console.log(array2);

      //detail 2: shortcut of destructuring. this helps get specific values we want out of an array. firstValue takes the first value and saves it into firstValue and secondValue does the same for the second one
      const [firstValue, secondValue] = [1, 2, 3];

      //more details about loops:
      //detail 3: break lets us exit a loop early. lets create a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but we want it to stop at 8. continue lets us skip 1 iteration of the loop. lets say we want to skip 3. tell the computer if i is 3 then skip the rest of the code and continue with the next iteration. replace by skipping a number that is divisible by 3. we can check if the remainder is 0 meaning it IS divisible by the first if

          break;
        }
      }

      //detail 4: be careful about using continue in a while loop as it will skip the increment step and will create an infinite loop. we have to do the increment step manually by adding it before continue to avoid the infinite loop and will successfully skip the numbers that are divisible by 3. in a while loop the increment step is done manually while in a for loop it is automatically done

        console.log(i);
        i++;
      }

      //detail 5: last detail we'll learn is how to use loops w functions. we want to create an array where the numbers are doubled from another array instead of the original being a variable called nums. we can do that by using a function w a parameter. now we can double it given any value/array

            return numsDoubled;
            //we can also use break to end the loop early here

      1. array = list of values
      2. loops (while loop, for loop)
      3. accumulator pattern
      4. created a todo list project
      5. array are references, destructuring
      6. more features of loops: break, continue, loops inside a function
