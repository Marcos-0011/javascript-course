    <!--the purpose of a div is to contain other HTML elements, it is a container. we cant use a paragraph element here bc we cant have a paragraph inside another paragraph element. instead we use a div which is a block element which means it takes up all the space to the right. divs also dont have any default styling of extra space around it unlike paragraph elements-->
