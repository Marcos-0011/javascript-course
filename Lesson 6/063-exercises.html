      }
      //isHoliday = true means it is a holiday, therefore we need to add the ! to isHoliday in the if condition to make the overall condition false bc discounts arent allowed on holidays. Which leads the computer to show no discount in the log. If isHoliday = false, then it would be true in the if condition bc of !. Which leads computer to show discount in console.
