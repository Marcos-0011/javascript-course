Can'start a variable name with a number. Can't use most special characters except $ and _. Use = to save value inside variable. In JS, semicolon ends an instruction, acts like a period.

Use const by default as it's safer for the code as it lets yk the permanent value of the variable. Another way to make a variable is to use var. But var has issues which is why it's not commonly used. If we have to use a variable, use let.
