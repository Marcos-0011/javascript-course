      //functions let us reuse code. write function, then give it a name. Can't use special words like function as a name, can't start w a number and can't use special characters except: $_. best practice is to use camelCase. function only creates a function, doesnt run any code, need to write it as below to 'run' the function
      /*
      function function1() {
        console.log('hello');
        console.log(2+2);
      }
      
      function1();
      function1();
      */

      //parameters: opposite of return as parameters puts a value into a function. parameter works the same way as a variable
      function calculateTax(cost, taxPercent = 0.1) {
        console.log(cost * taxPercent);
      }

      calculateTax(2000, 0.2);
      calculateTax(5000);
      //syntax rules for parameters: names go in round brackets of function. cant use special words like function, cant use special characters except $_, cant use numbers, and use camelCase
